## Story:
I had an html CV which I use to edit its raw index.html  when adding new input.
It was okay for a reason: Opening the html in any browser displays my CV without having to spring up servers to run python or php like would have been the case if frameworks like flask, Django, or wordpress. which makes very easy to host on github pages... free online prsence for life!!!  
Some drawbacks though:
1. It's not easily reusable by someone else, one has to go through all the tags and probably edit each lines for customizations.
2. To update the CV, the file will have to be edited will with the full markups which will at some point a very long html file...

**What if I can just supply a key value pairs and get my CV generated still without having to spin up a server for backend?**

## Solution
