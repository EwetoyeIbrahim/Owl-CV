# Owl_Cv

## Story:
I had an html CV which I use to edit its raw index.html  when adding new input.
It was okay for a reason: Opening the html in any browser displays my CV without having to spring up servers to run python or php like would have been the case if frameworks like flask, Django, or wordpress. which makes very easy to host on github pages... free online prsence for life!!!  
Some drawbacks though, to update the CV, the file will have to be edited will with the full markups which will at some point a very long html file...
**What if I can just supply a key value pairs and get my CV generated still without having to spin up a server?**

## Solution
Simply use one of the available designs, fill the values like name, job descriptions...; Using the power of Odoo's owl, your CV get computed and served on the go.  
Want to add new entries like experiences, education e.t.c? Simply add a new value and you are good to go!!!
